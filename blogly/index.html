                            <p>Starting this week, Facebook will begin a test to fact-check Instagram posts. Poynter reports that potentially false photos and memes shared on Instagram will be sent to the same dashboard that Facebook’s fact-checking partners — specialists like Factcheck.org as well as traditional news agencies like Associated Press — already use to identify misinformation on Facebook itself. If flagged as false, the distribution of these Instagram posts will be reduced to limit their spread. In particular, flagged posts will stop</p>

                                <p> Electronic Arts’ unlimited game subscription service that lets players access a massive library of EA games — is finally coming to the PlayStation 4 this July, almost five years after it launched on the Xbox One.

                                        Like the current Xbox offering, EA Access for the PS4 costs either $4.99 per month or $29.99 per year. In addition to unlimited access to EA’s vault of games, Access also comes with other perks, including a 10 percent discount on full-priced EA game purchases as well as early trials of upcoming EA games.</p>

                            <div><h3> HBO confirms that Game of Thrones’ Starbucks coffee cameo was a mistake</h3> <p>Of all the twists and turns on Game of Thrones’ most recent episode “The Last of the Starks,” the most shocking one for most of the internet was the appearance of an out-of-place cup of Starbucks coffee. Was it an uncharacteristic slip-up from one of the most expensive shows on television? Or perhaps it was a more sinister attempt at product placement for the ubiquitous coffee chain?
According to Bernie Caulfield, an executive producer on the show, the offending cup was just a simple mistake. “We’re sorry!” Caulfield said in an interview with WNYC radio today, before quipping that “Westeros was the first place to actually, you know, have Starbucks.”</p><div class="pro-read"> <a href="#"> Read More <span> <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i></span></a></div> 30 minutes ago</div>

                            <p>The oddest cameo in Avengers: Endgame isn’t from Stan Lee or co-director Joe Russo. The cameo by Fortnite, the popular online battle royale game, is the one with the biggest ramifications for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And that’s because it raises an awkward question: does Fortnite’s Thanos mode also exist in the Avengers universe? And if so, what does that mode look like in a post-Snap world?
FORTNITE IN AVENGERS OPENS UP A HUGE CAN OF WORMS
The limited-time Thanos game mode shook up the traditional Fortnite formula, forcing players to team up to fight against the super-powered, Infinity Gauntlet-wielding Mad Titan.  </p>

                                 <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized the dark web index and news site Deep Dot Web, according to a warning notice posted on the site. The site’s dark web site has also been taken down and replaced with a similar notice.

                                        The agency, according to the notice, seized the website with a warrant, working with computer crime investigators and European law enforcement. Two people in Israel were arrested in connection with the bust, according to local Israeli media, and authorities have also reportedly taken people in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Brazil into custody. The Times of Israel reports that the people are accused of taking commissions to send visitors to businesses offering illegal goods. </p>

                                   <p> On Tuesday, Google will kick off its annual I/O developer conference with a keynote led by CEO Sundar Pichai and other executives from the company. This is where Google outlines the many features and improvements coming to Android, Google Assistant, and many other of the company’s apps and services over the next year.

                                        This year will feel a bit different because Google is all but guaranteed to announce two new Pixel smartphones during the I/O presentation, adding a lower-cost option smack dab in the middle of the typical smartphone refresh cycle. You can still expect to hear a ton about AI advancements, machine learning, and, yes, even good old search over the course of the keynote. Here’s a preview of what’s likely to get time on Tuesday:</p>
